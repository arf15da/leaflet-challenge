# leaflet-challenge

Hello here is my submission for the leaflet challenge, I had difficulty doing this homework assignment. Object of this challenge was to plot and show earthquake data from the USGS. We were tasked with developing a way to visualize USGS data that will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding) on issues facing our planet.

You will find the source java script inside the LEAFLET-PART-1 folder inside the static subfolder inside the js subfolder titled "logic.js". Additionally formatting is under the css subfolder titled "style.css". The map can be launched from the index.html file.
